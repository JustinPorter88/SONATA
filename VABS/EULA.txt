Notwithstanding the foregoing, AnalySwift will not use or share any Confidential Information or personally identifiable Authorized User information with any third party. AnalySwift owns all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, and all other intellectual property rights pertaining thereto, together with all improvements or bug fixes thereto, regardless of whether the suggestion for such improvement was conceived by AnalySwift or conceived, suggested by, or commissioned by Customer or an Authorized User. For the avoidance of doubt, the Software and related services are not provided as a work for hire and nothing herein shall be construed as to vest any rights or ownership to the Software in Customer. Customer's (and each Authorized User's) right to use the Software shall be contingent upon Customer's continued and timely payment of the fees due under this Agreement.
       2.3. Limitations. Neither Customer nor any of its Authorized Users, employees, agents, or affiliates will (i) reproduce, modify or distribute all or any portion of the Software or any intellectual property relating to such, or (ii) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or access the computer code relating to the Software. The Software may only be used for lawful purposes and in a lawful manner, and as such Customer agrees to comply with all applicable laws, statutes and regulations. 
       2.4. Authorized User Access. Customer shall ensure that Authorized Users comply with the terms of this Agreement and any modifications hereto.

       3.2. Upfront License. If Customer is not using the Software pursuant to a trial license, an initial license payment is due at the time this Agreement is accepted. No fees other than this initial license payment are due during Customer's first year of using the Software.

AnalySwift will deliver invoices to Customer at the email address provided herein on or before the one year anniversary of this Agreement and every year thereafter (or on the following business day, if such day falls on a weekend or U.S. holiday). All annual license fees are due upon receipt of invoice, but in any case shall be paid to AnalySwift within 15 days of receipt. Customer shall be responsible for requesting a duplicate invoice if Customer does not receive an invoice as provided above within 3 days of the anticipated invoice date.

       3.5. Lost Invoices; Overdue Accounts. AnalySwift will charge interest on all late payments, including those resulting from lost, forgotten or misplaced invoices, at the lesser of (a) the maximum amount chargeable by law or (b) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month. Failure to timely pay undisputed invoices may cause interruption of Service. If Customer fails to pay an invoice within 60 days after the invoice date, AnalySwift reserves the right to terminate the Agreement upon 30 days' written notification to Customer.  

4. WARRANTIES, DISCLAIMERS 
       4.1. Limited Warranty. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF PERFORMANCE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Customer's exclusive remedy for breach by AnalySwift of its limited warranty shall be to discontinue use of the Software and terminate this Agreement. Customer agrees that AnalySwift's liability hereunder for any type of damages whatsoever, regardless of the form of action, shall not exceed the aggregate dollar amount paid by Customer to AnalySwift in the 12 months prior to the claimed injury or damage.

Each Party agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party, its affiliates, employees, officers, agents, licensors and successors and assigns from all damages and liability including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred as a result of such Party's violation of its obligations under this Agreement, or the negligent or willful acts of such Party, or violation of any third party property rights.

6. CONFIDENTIALITY.
        6.1. During the Term and for a period of 5 years after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Party receiving Confidential Information ("Receiving Party") from the other Party ("Disclosing Party") in connection with this Agreement agrees (i) to hold such Confidential Information in strict confidence, (ii) not to use, copy or modify such Confidential Information other than to perform its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement; and (iii) not to disclose any such Confidential Information to any third party. The Receiving Party shall take security precautions and afford the same degree of care, handling and storage of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information at least as great as the precautions, care, handling and storage it takes to protect its own Confidential Information, and in all events reasonable precautions, to keep confidential the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party is fully liable and responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any person or entity to whom or which it provides, or provides access to, any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.
        6.2. Notwithstanding Section 6.1, the restrictions on disclosure of Confidential Information do not apply to information that: (i) is or becomes publicly known, through no fault of the Receiving Party; (ii) was known by the Receiving Party prior to disclosure hereunder; (iii) is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party with no violation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; or (iv) is developed by the Receiving Party independent of any use of information disclosed by the Disclosing Party. In addition, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information as required to be disclosed by a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental body, or by law, rule or regulation, provided that, to the extent permitted by applicable law or regulation, the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prompt written notice of such requirement prior to such disclosure and limits the disclosure to the minimum amount of information that is required, and may disclose the terms of this Agreement to its professional advisors who are bound by confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations that are consistent with this Agreement.
        6.3. Upon termination of this Agreement and request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall return to the Disclosing Party all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party that is in the possession or control of the Receiving Party, including all copies thereof and other tangible and intangible embodiments thereof.
        6.4. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the Disclosing Party believes that its Confidential Information is unique property of extreme value to the Disclosing Party, and that the unauthorized use or disclosure thereof would cause the Disclosing Party irreparable harm that could not be compensated by monetary damages. Accordingly, the Receiving Party agrees that the Disclosing Party may seek injunctive and preliminary relief to remedy any actual or threatened unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies available to the Disclosing Party, without the posting of a bond or other security.

       7.6. Force Majeure. Except for the payment of fees by Customer, if the performance of any part of this Agreement is prevented, hindered, delayed or otherwise made impracticable by reason of any cause or event not within the reasonable control of such Party and without its fault or negligence, that Party shall be excused from such to the extent that it is prevented, hindered or delayed by such causes.
