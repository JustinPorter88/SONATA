- Requirements:
    
    
- Design Variables:
    continuous, discrete or quasidiscrete
       
    
- Objective function:
    
    
- state variables of interest:
    
- constant parameters (that remain unchanged throughout the optimization process).
- performance requirements 
    -set of applied loads
    - 



A Mono-Optimization basic set of tools:
- A Dicipline Module that performs an analysis using a given set of design variables to compute the state variables.
- A Search Module that endeavors to make changes to the design variables in order to generate an imporved value for the objective function
- A constraint satisfaction module, that ensures the solutions offered do not violate the design constraints. In reality ther is not normally a specific 
    stand-alone moduke that exclusively ensures constraint satisfactrion but a process for ensuring constraint satisfaction


Software Tool Requirements:
